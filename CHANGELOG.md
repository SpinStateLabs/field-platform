# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added - Phase G: authenticated operators (code only, not armed)
- `field_core.operator_auth`: operator keys (`x-field-operator`, `x-field-operator-key`), a local
  `operators.json` verifier (sha256 only, constant-time, scoped), `FIELD_OPERATOR_REGISTRY`
  (log-only) and `FIELD_OPERATOR_REQUIRE` (enforce), both unset by default.
- Guarded writes: kill, kill/domain, revive, drill, attest, rotate, hold, hold/release, mint,
  decommission. 401 no key; 403 wrong key / mismatch / scope / not in `authorized_operators`
  (identical body); 503 when the operator registry is unreadable; 400 on malformed headers.
- Ledger payloads carry `operator_id_authenticated`, `operator_claimed`, `operator_key_fp`.
- `tools/operator_keygen.py`; internal callers present `FIELD_OPERATOR` / `FIELD_OPERATOR_KEY`.
- Kill-switch README Enforced-vs-Declared row; runbook section 7.
- Not deployed, not armed. Arming `FIELD_OPERATOR_REQUIRE` is not undone by an image rollback.

### Phase G review round (independent red team)
- Guarded: registry `PATCH` with `status`, delegation token revoke, ledger `/retention/apply`, lifecycle `/sweep`.
- `POST /events`: reserved operator keys are dropped unless the caller holds the `assert_operator` scope.
- Unresolvable manifest denies; empty `authorized_operators` still requires authentication; body operator replaced by the authenticated id; BOM and lone-surrogate registry handling; bounded log-only ledger write; ops-console forwards the human's headers.

### Phase G second review round
- Registry PATCH honours `authorized_operators`; `registry_edit` scope for manifest_ref/owner; `retired -> active` refused.
- Guarded: `POST /agents` (`register`), ledger `/export` (confined to `FIELD_EXPORT_ROOT`), spend-governor caps/rate-limits/policies/escalations, federation contracts.
- Flags-OFF byte-identical (reserved-key rewrite and `operator.*` refusal only when armed); attribution-loss warning; capped log-only appends; ops-console sign-in panel.
