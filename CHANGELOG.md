# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added - Phase G: authenticated operators (code only, not armed)
- `field_core.operator_auth`: operator keys (`x-field-operator`, `x-field-operator-key`), a local
  `operators.json` verifier (sha256 only, constant-time, scoped), `FIELD_OPERATOR_REGISTRY`
  (log-only) and `FIELD_OPERATOR_REQUIRE` (enforce), both unset by default.
- Guarded writes: kill, kill/domain, revive, drill, attest, rotate, hold, hold/release, mint,
  decommission. 401 no key; 403 wrong key / mismatch / scope / not in `authorized_operators`
  (identical body); 503 when the operator registry is unreadable; 400 on malformed headers.
- Ledger payloads carry `operator_id_authenticated`, `operator_claimed`, `operator_key_fp`.
- `tools/operator_keygen.py`; internal callers present `FIELD_OPERATOR` / `FIELD_OPERATOR_KEY`.
- Kill-switch README Enforced-vs-Declared row; runbook section 7.
- Not deployed, not armed. Arming `FIELD_OPERATOR_REQUIRE` is not undone by an image rollback.
